### Comparative Analysis of Customer Sentiments on Competing Brands using Hybrid Model Approach

Customer sentiment is one of the vital aspects
essential for transforming business approaches to deal with
competitors in today’s fast paced market. Any large company
will deal with a lot of customers every day and thus it is not
practically feasible to get individual feedbacks from each of
them. Through social networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook
etc. information can be gained through customers sentiments,
which can be used by the businesses to derive insights and make
decisions regarding improving their product quality. In this
paper, we utilize the approach of sentiment analysis to derive
individual user perceptions about the different features of the
new releases of two leading Smartphone brands in India- Vivo
and Oppo. The tweets pertaining to the two smartphones Vivo
Nex and Oppo FindX are used as individual customer feedback
and the sentiment for each tweet is classified using a hybrid
model which is a combination of the Lexicon Based Sentiment
analysis and the Naive Bayes algorithms, thus obtaining better
accuracy. Then, the overall sentiments for each of the two
smartphones is compared which provide a bird’s eye view of the
user perceptions about the two mobiles. Lastly, we dig further to
compare the user sentiments of the individual features in the two
smartphones which acts as a powerful feedback mechanism for
companies, which they could use to make immediate corrections
or utilize this for improving the design of their subsequent
models.
